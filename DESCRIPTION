Description: This package contains the functions that will encode messages using the RSA methodology. These functions include:
  The random prime number generator of an inputted bit size that outputs a prime number of the provided bit size. 
  The key encryption function which needs the input of two unique large prime integers to generate the public and private keys.
  The message encryption function which encrypts an inputted plaintext using the inputted public key and outputs the ciphertext
  The message decryption function which decrypts an inputted ciphertext using the inputted private key and outputs the plaintext
